# MaskRCNN-Nuclei-segmentation

Final project for our coursework 4 for the Machine Learning Practical course. We adapted this implementation of MaskRCNN for the 2018 Data Science Bowl competition on Kaggle where the task was to detect nuclei on medical images. We were 3 people working on this project for 4 weeks.

Credit to [matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) for the initial implementation. The implementation is described in the original [Mask RCNN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870). The report associated is what we submitted alongside the code.
